I am a Master’s student at National Tsing Hua University (College of Semiconductor Research), advised by Prof. [Chi-Chun (Jeremy) Lee](https://biic.ee.nthu.edu.tw/biicers.php). During my master’s studies, I also visited Prof. [Carlos Busso](https://www.carlosbusso.com/)’s [Multimodal Speech Processing (MSP) Lab](https://lab-msp.com/) at The University of Texas at Dallas.

My work focuses on `emotion recognition` and `biosignal analysis`, with an emphasis on reducing aliasing introduced by front-end deep-learning preprocessing to improve downstream performance. In parallel, I develop human-in-the-loop generative components that enable targeted intervention in model outputs, increasing transparency and user trust. Broadly, I’m interested in `multi-task learning` and `multimodal interaction`.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
